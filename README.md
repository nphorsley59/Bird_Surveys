# Monitoring of Beneficial Birds in Agricultural Ecosystems

### <div align="center">Project Overview</div>
In the Fall of 2019, a colleague and I launched the Monitoring of Beneficial Birds in Agricultural Ecosystems initiative. The purpose of this project is to connect sustainable land use practices with changes in native bird communities. We are particularly interested in species that provide ecosystem services or are of conservation concern. To date, we have completed two survey seasons (Fall 2019 and Spring 2020) at five organic farms in Ford County, Illinois. Our current goal is to secure an additional 5 years of funding ($10,000) to support seasonal surveys and an undergraduate researcher at the University of Illinois.

### <div align="center">Results</div>
**Fall 2019**<br />
Surveys were conducted by Noah Horsley and Colin Dobson in October at all five participating farms. This was our pilot season; our goals were to test out various data collection methods and get an idea of the time and monetary resources necessary to sample multiple times per year.

**Spring 2019**<br />
Surveys were conducted by Colin Dobson in late May at all five participating farms. This was our first real field season and yielded a lot of good diversity, abundance, and habitat data. At Cow Creek, our largest farm, we detected a stunning 59 species, including three Yellow-billed Cuckoos, a Great Crested Flycatcher, and two Blue Grosbeaks! At Craver Trust, our second-largest farm, we detected 56 species, including a Yellow-bellied Flycatcher (rare) and a pair of breeding Upland Sandpipers! Some other highlights included two breeding pairs of Bobolinks at R Wildlife Farm and Fields (the southern edge of their breeding range), five Cliff Swallows (unusual in conventional agriculture) at J&W, and a large population of Grasshopper Sparrows (fairly strict habitat requirements) at D&Q. Compared with the bird communities of the broader agricultural landscape in Illinois, these organic farms are incredibely diverse. They appear to be refuges for many native breeding songbirds and could play an important role in songbird conservation. The complete survey results from this season are published on Tableau Public<sup>1</sup>.<br />
